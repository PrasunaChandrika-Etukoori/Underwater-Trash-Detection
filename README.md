# 🌊 Underwater Trash Detection (Binary Classification)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify underwater images into **Trash** or **Not Trash** using the **SeaClear / Kaggle Underwater Trash Detection Dataset**.  
The model is trained and evaluated in Google Colab, with all steps documented in the included Jupyter Notebook.

## 📘 Context

Marine pollution has become a major global concern, with tons of waste accumulating underwater every year. This trash harms marine life, damages coral reefs, and disrupts ecosystems.  
Manually detecting underwater trash is slow, costly, and often risky for divers.

This project uses **Deep Learning** to automatically classify underwater images as **Trash** or **Not Trash**. By training a CNN on real underwater images, this model can assist in:

- 🌊 Ocean cleanup and monitoring  
- 🤖 Underwater drones/ROVs for debris detection  
- 🧪 Marine research and pollution analysis  
- 🌍 Sustainability and environmental protection  

This project demonstrates how AI can support marine conservation by identifying underwater waste more efficiently.
